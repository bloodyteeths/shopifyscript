# Proofkit — Final Roadmap & Agent Contract (vFINAL 2025-08-13)

> Directive for Cursor: Use this file as the sole source of truth starting with the next task. Do not rewrite completed modules unless tests fail. Follow release trains R0→R3 and milestones M0→M9 in order, using small diffs. Respect feature flags as documented (CM_API stays OFF). For any conflict with earlier specs, vFINAL supersedes.
